# Welcome to Typed Web

This is the source repository for Typed Web. It is under active development.

## Goals

Typed Web is a collection of TypeScript libraries and tools for building type-safe web applications. Our goal is to provide developers with robust, type-safe solutions for common web development tasks, enhancing productivity and code quality.

## Packages

We currently publish the following packages:

- [valibot-form-data](packages/valibot-form-data): A set of Valibot validators for parsing and validating `FormData` (but also `URLSearchParams`) objects. It's inspired by Zod's `zod-form-data` package but built with Valibot.
